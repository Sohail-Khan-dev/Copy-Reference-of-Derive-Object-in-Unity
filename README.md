# Copy-Reference-of-Derive-Object-in-Unity
I have a game object with a script attached to it. I've connected all the properties in the editor. Now I'm trying to create a similar object which instead uses a derived class component. I want to copy all the properties that I've connected in the base class component to the derived class component.
